##Data Features
The features for the new dataset were created from the transformation of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" data. The data were collected from experiments where 30 volunteers participated in six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, standing, sitting, and lying) while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II on their hips. From motion, acceleration, and positioning programming data were collected.
